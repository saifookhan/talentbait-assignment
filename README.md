### Feedback

- Overall assignment was not so diffcult.
- What was challenging was to merge Reflux with React.
- It was hard to find proper documentation for Reflux specially with newer version of React.
- I did have an idea about one-way data cycle when I used Redux but I was surprized this is was quite easy and simple to use and implement. :D
- As for the styling, I used custom css file as we discussed about this earlier.
- No design library was used in this.
- I did try to make things look nice but didn't put much energy into styling things properly.
